      <h2>My Travel Experiences</h2>
      <p>One of the most fascinating experiences I’ve had was during my trip to Meghalaya. I witnessed an incredible natural phenomenon where water seemed to defy gravity by flowing uphill instead of down. It was a mesmerizing and surreal sight, reminding me of the hidden wonders of nature.</p>
      <p>Another memorable journey was my visit to Rishikesh, where I experienced the thrill of white-water rafting on the Ganges. The adrenaline rush, the icy cold water splashing against my face, and the breathtaking views of the Himalayas made it an unforgettable adventure.</p>
      <p>Additionally, my trek to the Kedarkantha summit was an eye-opening experience. Trekking through knee-deep snow, witnessing a golden sunrise from the peak, and feeling a sense of accomplishment at 12,500 feet was truly a moment of self-discovery.</p>
